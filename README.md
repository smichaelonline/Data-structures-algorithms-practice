## Notes 

#### Big-O Notation 
The way of describing a realtionship about the runtime of algorithm growth as the input grows 

O(n): runtime is based on n - as n grows, runtime grows 
O(n<sup>2<sup>): as n grows the runtime grows to the rate of n squared 
- is an O(n) operation inside of an O(n) operation
O(1): constant. Takes roughly the same amount of time throughout

**As n grows how does that reflect in the runtime?**
