// write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum? 
/* 
? Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  - We have to write a function that adds two numbers
? What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  !ask yourself!: How large are the numbers going to be?
  - Int? 
  - Float? 
  - String for large numbers?
? What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? 
  - Total of the two inputs but will we be using Int? Float? String? 
? Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem? 
  - What if the user only inputs one number? We would not have enough information to run the algorithm. *good point to ask interviewer
? How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem? 
  - Labels will be num 1 and num 2 as the arguments. the result of the algoritm in our return would be sum.
